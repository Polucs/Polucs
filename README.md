- Hi hi Hello!!! I'm Pollux! I'm a TV Head, a semi-decent writer, and I have a lot of friends!
- I LOVE Team Fortress 2, Sonic, Pony Town, DBZ (and DBS), Xenoverse 2, ULTRAKILL, Minecraft, ROBLOX and a lot of other stuff I can't really remember rn
- I'm taken, so no getting too freaky with me, alright? JOKE FLIRTING is allowed though
- I'm from Brazil! It's not as cool as you think, and climate change made it twice as worse.
- I go by He/Him, but honestly, you can call me anything, I don't take that too seriously.
- Here's my strawpage for a little more info on me + fanarts made by my friends: https://polluxtvhead.straw.page

- Fun fact: Someone really likes your presence, but isn't brave enough to say it out loud because that's usually frowned down upon!
